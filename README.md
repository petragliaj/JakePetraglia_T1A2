## Purpose of Assignment

Research, plan and publish my own personal portfolio website using the skills I've learnt throughtout the first few weeks of the bootcamp. 


## Functionality & Features

A fully responsive website across all devices that utilises both semantic and non semantic HTML and CSS to convey my design choices and aesthetic. 

I've chosen to go with a colourful yet minimalistc approach for the flow of my website. I wanted the user to be able to seemlessly move from page to page with the use of my navbar and clearly define each page with the use of background image elements. 

The website contains four web pages; the Home, About, Blog and contact. 

These pages consist of:

- Home: A simple page that can be viewed in it's entirety with a simple introduction as to my name, what i'm studying, links to my socials and a navbar to easily navigate to the follow pages. 
- About: A biography page showcasing a simple introduction to who am I and my background. Another component with my most recent work and study history and lastly a brief summary of some of my hobbies. 
- Blog: A blog page that consists of 5 blog posts containing a blog title, short blog text and an image. 
- Contact: A simple contact page that directs you to my Linkedin profile, github and my most recent resume. 

## Target Audience 

The target audience is for potential employers and recruiters to take a look at my portfolio website that showcases my understanding of html and css in web development.
