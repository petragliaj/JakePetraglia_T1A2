I was born in Melbourne, Australia, but grew in a country town called Bendigo. I've always loved to travel and I studied Japanese at RMIT University. Most recently I've taken in interest in Programming and Web Development. I've always felt intimidated by coding, but I'm so glad I've taken the leap into learning as much as I can about web development through the Coderacademy Bootcamp as it has been such an immensely rewarding experience.</p>

Reading manga is another pastime of mine; I find it hard to put a series down once I've started. I also love to play with my cat Paarthurnax (named after my favourite dragon from Skyrim)
                                 and of course, spending time with my girlfriend and family.</p>
